# Parameter choice, stability and validity for robust cluster weighted modeling
This repository is associated with the paper Cappozzo, Garcìa Escudero, Greselin, Mayo-Iscar (2021) *Parameter choice, stability and validity for robust cluster weighted modeling.*

R routines to implement the methodology and the scripts necessary to reproduce results from the paper are available in the *code* folder. When the *Monitoring_CWRM_STATS.R* file is run, plots will be saved in the *output* folder
